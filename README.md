# to-do-ru
Rust Based To-Do List Project

The goal off this project is to create a to-do list program that *I* actually want to use in my everyday life. In general to-do lists are good to integrate into workflows - the small reward of checking off this list when a task is complete is great for improving motivation - however I personally do not currently have one, nor do I plan on installing some random to-do list software or even getting a physical list. 

That's why I figured what better way to integrate this into my workflow then creating one personalized for my needs myself, and learning Rust at the same time!
